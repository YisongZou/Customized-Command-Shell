# Customized-Command-Shell

➢ Using C++ to construct a multi-process application that supports functionality of Linux Shell. Achieved the
majority part of operations by parsing user input in parent process and invoking system calls in child process.
➢ Designed built in commands to provide access to variables and enhanced it by exporting to and exchanging with environment variables in patent process. Analyzed and handled failures by detecting PID, signal an exit status.

Makefile is provided, to compile just run:

-make
